#PROCESS HOW TO LIVE AND DEPLOY OUR REACT VITE PROJECT IN GITHUB 

To deploy a React Vite project through a GitHub repository and make it live, follow these steps:

Prepare Your Project:

Ensure your project is in a Git repository.
If not, initialize it with git init and commit your files.
Install gh-pages:

Run npm install gh-pages --save-dev to install the gh-pages package as a dev dependency.
Configure package.json:

Add a homepage field: "homepage": "https://<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/<REPOSITORY_NAME>",
Add deployment scripts:
JSON

"scripts": {
  "gh-pages-build": "vite build --base=/<REPOSITORY_NAME>/",
  "gh-pages-deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
  // other scripts...
}

Configure vite.config.js (if necessary):

If you’re using a custom domain or need to set a base path, update vite.config.js:
JavaScript

import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
export default defineConfig({
  base: "/<REPOSITORY_NAME>/"
  // other configs
});
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Build Your App:

Run npm run gh-pages-build to build your app for production.
Deploy to GitHub Pages:

Run npm run gh-pages-deploy to deploy your app to GitHub Pages.
Verify Deployment:

Your app should now be live at https://<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/<REPOSITORY_NAME>.
Update Deployment:

To update your live app, repeat steps 5 and 6 after making changes to your project.
Note: If you’re using client-side routing with React Router, you may need to use HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter for proper routing on GitHub Pages1.

For automated deployments using GitHub Actions, you can set up a workflow that builds and deploys your app whenever you push changes to your repository2. This can streamline the process and save you from running the build and deploy commands manually.

Remember to replace <GITHUB_USERNAME> and <REPOSITORY_NAME> with your actual GitHub username and repository name.
